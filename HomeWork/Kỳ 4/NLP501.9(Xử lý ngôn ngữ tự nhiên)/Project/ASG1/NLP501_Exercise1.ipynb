' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . \nthe only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production \" anastasia , \" but disney's \" hercules , \" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation . \nthis year , it's no contest , as \" quest for camelot \" is pretty much dead on arrival . \neven the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be \" pocahontas \" for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this . \nthe story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table . \nkayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . \nwith the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side . \n \" quest for camelot \" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . \nthere's nothing here that differentiates \" quest \" from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . \n ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra . \ni rest my case . ) \neven the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \nin the end , it's a tie -- they all win . \nthat dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \nat least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel \" urkel \" white and bronson \" balki \" pinchot sharing the same footage . \na few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \nbut one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \naside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , \" quest for camelot \" 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \nand personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . \n",

         "synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n",
